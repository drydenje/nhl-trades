          "The 2020 first-round pick from Arizona in the Taylor Hall trade is top-three protected. Converts to 2021, if so.\n\nThe conditions on the 2021 pick are as follows: the third-round pick in 2021 becomes a second-round selection if Arizona wins a Stanley Cup Playoff round OR Taylor Hall re-signs in Arizona. The third-round pick in 2021 becomes a first-round selection if Arizona wins a Stanley Cup Playoff round AND Taylor Hall re-signs in Arizona. If neither condition happens, New Jersey still receives the 2021 third-round pick.",

          "The 2019 2nd rounder is the better of San Jose's own or Florida's own, previously acquired. \nIf the Sharks miss the playoffs in 2018-19, the 2019 or 2020 first-rounder will be in 2019; otherwise, itâ€™s a 2020 first-round pick that will go to Ottawa. \nIf the Sharks re-sign Karlsson the Senators receive a conditional second-round pick in 2021 which would become a first-round pick if the Sharks make it to the Stanley Cup Final in 2019. \nIf Karlsson is on an Eastern Conference roster (reserve list during the 2018-19 season, the Sharks would have to send the Senators an additional first-round pick no later than 2022.\n",

          "The third-round pick becomes a second-rounder if the Ducks win two playoff rounds. If it's a third-round pick, it will be in 2016. If it is escalated to a second-round pick, that selection will be made in 2017. The pick will not be escalted unless McGinn plays in more than 50 per cent of the Ducks' playoff games.",
